                <p>"Customer service is the assistance and advice provided by a company to those people who buy or use its products or services. Each industry requires different levels of customer service, but towards the end, the idea of a well-performed service is that of increasing revenues. The perception of success of the customer service interactions is dependent on employees who can adjust themselves to the personality of the customer".Customer service is often practiced in a way that reflects the strategies and values of a firm. Good quality customer service is usually measured through customer retention. Customer service for some firms is part of the firmâ€™s intangible assets and can differentiate it from others in the industry. One good customer service experience can change the entire perception a customer holds towards the organization."
